KNImageCache
===========================

This is a simple class to help you cache images to local disk if you use some other framework (e.g [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)) to
request image which does't provide disk cache but memory cache.You use the key (the url of image) to distinguish 
whether the image exist on the disk.
